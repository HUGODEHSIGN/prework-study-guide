# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Prework Study Guide is a place for boot camp students to place notes in an easy to reach place. While learning code, it's almost certain that students will run into problems down the line that they've encountered before. By documenting the way they've pushed through issues in the past, these notes will allow the students to get back on track quickly.
